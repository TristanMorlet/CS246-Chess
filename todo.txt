Ok I added a pretty simple solution (isDanger to board)
To generalize I think we add a flag to Move to check if a move would be "dangerous".
^Can be used for higher level ai for an avoid capture gamestyle.
I also think we add a flag for "hasMoved" to Move for first move game logic. 
just do like int hasMoved = 0. We can increment it every time and if != 0 then no more fun moves
^Can also be a bonus ft? We can pretty easily do total moves or like "most used piece" idk


We could also even add levels to the human stuff for fun
Like if we're on training mode we can issue a warning to player if move is dangerous
Later obviously
